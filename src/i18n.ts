Seed Rate: Use 30-40 kg/ha for transplanting.\n6. Nursery Management: Maintain a 21-25 day nursery period; use DAP for healthy seedlings.\n7. Spacing: Plant at 20x15cm or 15x15cm depending on the variety.\n8. Fertilizer: Apply NPK in 120:60:40 ratio; split Nitrogen into 3 applications.\n9. Water Management: Keep 2-5cm standing water from transplanting until grain hardening.\n10. Weed Control: Use pre-emergence herbicides within 3-5 days of transplanting.\n11. Pest Monitoring: Watch for Stem Borer, Gall Midge, and Leaf Folder.\n12. Disease Management: Preventive sprays for Blast and Brown Spot are recommended.\n13. Zinc Deficiency: Apply 25kg/ha Zinc Sulphate if leaves show brown spots.\n14. Harvesting: Harvest when grains are 80-85% straw-colored and moisture is ~20%.\n15. Post-Harvest: Dry grains to 12-14% moisture before long-term storage."

Climate: Needs cool temperatures (15-20°C) during growth and bright sun for ripening.\n3. Land Preparation: 2-3 deep ploughings followed by levelling for a fine seedbed.\n4. Sowing Time: November is the peak season; late sowing reduces yield significantly.\n5. Seed Rate: 100-125 kg/ha; use higher rates for late sowing or saline soils.\n6. Sowing Depth: 4-5cm deep using a seed drill for uniform emergence.\n7. Fertilizer: 120kg N, 60kg P2O5, and 40kg K2O per hectare.\n8. Critical Irrigation: Must irrigate at Crown Root Initiation (CRI) stage (21 days after sowing).\n9. Additional Irrigation: Tillering, Jointing, Flowering, and Milk stages are also critical.\n10. Micro-nutrients: Apply Manganese and Zinc if deficiency symptoms appear.\n11. Weed Control: Use Isoproturon or Clodinafop-propargyl for grassy weeds.\n12. Rust Management: Monitor for Yellow (Stripe) and Brown Rust; use Tilt if needed.\n13. Karnal Bunt: Use resistant varieties and avoid excessive irrigation during flowering.\n14. Harvest: Harvest when moisture content is <15% and grains are hard.\n15. Storage: Keep in moisture-proof containers to prevent fungal growth."

Prep: Plough 15-20cm deep; apply 10-15 tons of FYM (Farm Yard Manure).\n5. Spacing: 90x60cm for hybrids or 60x15cm for high-density planting.\n6. Seed Treatment: Treat with Imidacloprid to protect from sucking pests (30 days).\n7. Fertilizer: NPK in 150:75:75 ratio for Bt Cotton hybrids.\n8. Thinning: Remove weak seedlings 10-15 days after germination to maintain spacing.\n9. Inter-cultivation: Hand hoeing at 20, 40, and 60 days to remove weeds.\n10. Irrigation: Protect from moisture stress during squaring and boll development.\n11. Pest Management: Bollworms (Pink/American) are major threats; use pheromone traps.\n12. Sucking Pests: Monitor Jassids and Whiteflies throughout the vegetative stage.\n13. Growth Regulators: Apply Mepiquat Chloride to control excessive vegetative growth.\n14. Picking: Handpick mature bolls when 50-70% are fully opened.\n15. Post-Harvest: Sort clean cotton from stained bolls for better market price."
